# [Jobify](https://mern-jobify-4g31.onrender.com/landing) - Job Tracking Application :briefcase:

## Prior considerations :thinking:

This project has a mere educational motivation, therefore, I chose the free-tier Render.com servers to deploy it, which have the downside of shutting down after 15 minutes of inactivity. Hence, I ask for a little bit of patience when first loading the application, since it could take about 30 seconds to load (it works normally after the first load).


## What is it about? :bulb:

Jobify is a job tracking app that allows the user to create an account and to add his/her job applications, track them and update their status.

It includes informative cards and graphs to help the user visualize an overview of his last jobs applications. The profile tab allows the user to update his/her profile data.

It is totally responsive for small screens.

## How does it work? :gear:

* The first thing you will see when you open the app is the landing page. You will need to login in order to see and use the functionality of the app.
* You have two options for log in:
  * You can use the Demo App button to see the app without having to register a new account. Keep in mind you will have restricted functionality.
  * Create a new account, log in with it, and experience the full Jobify experience right away!
* After logging in, you will be redirected to the Dashboard, where you will see an informative overview of your last jobs applications. On the left panel, just navigate through using the buttons in order to see all the features.

## Options :wrench:

The app includes dark and light mode options. The dashboard page allows the user to swap between Area or Bar Chart.
